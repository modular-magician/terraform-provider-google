## Example Usage - Cloudbuild Trigger Filename


```hcl
resource "google_cloudbuild_trigger" "filename-trigger" {
  trigger_template {
    branch_name = "master"
    repo_name   = "my-repo"
  }

  substitutions = {
    _FOO = "bar"
    _BAZ = "qux"
  }

  filename = "cloudbuild.yaml"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:



- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Human-readable description of the trigger.

* `disabled` -
  (Optional)
  Whether the trigger is disabled or not. If true, the trigger will never result in a build.

* `substitutions` -
  (Optional)
  Substitutions data for Build resource.

* `filename` -
  (Optional)
  Path, from the source root, to a file whose contents is used for the template.

* `ignored_files` -
  (Optional)
  ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using http://godoc/pkg/path/filepath#Match
  extended with support for `**`.
  If ignoredFiles and changed files are both empty, then they are not
  used to determine whether or not to trigger a build.
  If ignoredFiles is not empty, then we ignore any files that match any
  of the ignored_file globs. If the change has no files that are outside
  of the ignoredFiles globs, then we do not trigger a build.

* `included_files` -
  (Optional)
  ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using http://godoc/pkg/path/filepath#Match
  extended with support for `**`.
  If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
  and includedFiles is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we
  should trigger the build.
  If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
  and includedFiles is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of
  those files matches a includedFiles glob. If not, then we do not trigger
  a build.

* `trigger_template` -
  (Optional)
  Template describing the types of source changes to trigger a build.
  Branch and tag names in trigger templates are interpreted as regular
  expressions. Any branch or tag change that matches that regular
  expression will trigger a build.  Structure is documented below.

* `build` -
  (Optional)
  Contents of the build template.  Structure is documented below.
* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

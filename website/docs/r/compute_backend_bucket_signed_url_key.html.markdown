# google\_compute\_backend\_bucket\_signed\_url\_key

Represents a key used to sign Cloud CDN signed URLs for a BackendBucket 
resource.

To get more information about BackendBucketSignedUrlKey, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendBuckets)
* How-to Guides
    * [Using Signed URLs](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/using-signed-urls/)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including the key's value will be stored in the raw
 state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).
 However, because the API does not return the sensitive key value,
 we cannot confirm if a key has been changed outside of Terraform.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_compute_backend_bucket_signed_url_key" "image_signed_url_key" {
  name         = "my-key"
  key_value    = "..."
  backend_name = "${google_compute_backend_bucket.image_backend.name}"
}

resource "google_compute_backend_bucket" "image_backend" {
  name        = "image-backend-bucket"
  description = "Contains beautiful images"
  bucket_name = "${google_storage_bucket.image_bucket.name}"
  enable_cdn  = true
}

resource "google_storage_bucket" "image_bucket" {
  name     = "image-store-bucket"
  location = "EU"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the signed URL key. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and
  comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
  long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
  which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
  following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
  except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

* `key_value` -
  (Required)
  128-bit key value used for signing the URL. The key value must be a
  valid RFC 4648 Section 5 base64url encoded string.

* `backend_name` -
  (Required)
  The backend bucket this signed URL key belongs.


- - -

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

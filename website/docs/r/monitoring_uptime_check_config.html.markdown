## Example Usage - Uptime Check Config Http


```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_uptime_check_config" "http" {
  display_name = "http-uptime-check"
  timeout = "60s"

  http_check {
    path = "/some-path"
    port = "8010"
  }

  monitored_resource {
    type = "uptime_url"
    labels = {
      project_id = "example"
      host = "192.168.1.1"
    }
  }

  content_matchers {
    content = "example"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Uptime Check Tcp


```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_uptime_check_config" "tcp_group" {
  display_name = "tcp-uptime-check"
  timeout = "60s"

  tcp_check {
    port = 888
  }

  resource_group {
    resource_type = "INSTANCE"
    group_id = "${google_monitoring_group.check.name}"
  }
}


resource "google_monitoring_group" "check" {
  display_name = "uptime-check-group"
  filter = "resource.metadata.name=has_substring(\"foo\")"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `display_name` -
  (Required)
  A human-friendly name for the uptime check configuration. The display name should be unique within a Stackdriver Workspace in order to make it easier to identify; however, uniqueness is not enforced.

* `timeout` -
  (Required)
  The maximum amount of time to wait for the request to complete (must be between 1 and 60 seconds). Accepted formats https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Duration


The `display_name` block supports:

The `timeout` block supports:

- - -


* `period` -
  (Optional)
  How often, in seconds, the uptime check is performed. Currently, the only supported values are 60s (1 minute), 300s (5 minutes), 600s (10 minutes), and 900s (15 minutes). Optional, defaults to 300s.

* `content_matchers` -
  (Optional)
  The expected content on the page the check is run against. Currently, only the first entry in the list is supported, and other entries will be ignored. The server will look for an exact match of the string in the page response's content. This field is optional and should only be specified if a content match is required.  Structure is documented below.

* `selected_regions` -
  (Optional)
  The list of regions from which the check will be run. Some regions contain one location, and others contain more than one. If this field is specified, enough regions to include a minimum of 3 locations must be provided, or an error message is returned. Not specifying this field will result in uptime checks running from all regions.

* `is_internal` -
  (Optional)
  If this is true, then checks are made only from the 'internal_checkers'. If it is false, then checks are made only from the 'selected_regions'. It is an error to provide 'selected_regions' when is_internal is true, or to provide 'internal_checkers' when is_internal is false.

* `internal_checkers` -
  (Optional)
  The internal checkers that this check will egress from. If is_internal is true and this list is empty, the check will egress from all the InternalCheckers configured for the project that owns this CheckConfig.  Structure is documented below.

* `http_check` -
  (Optional)
  Contains information needed to make an HTTP or HTTPS check.  Structure is documented below.

* `tcp_check` -
  (Optional)
  Contains information needed to make a TCP check.  Structure is documented below.

* `resource_group` -
  (Optional)
  The group resource associated with the configuration.  Structure is documented below.

* `monitored_resource` -
  (Optional)
  The monitored resource (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/resources) associated with the configuration. The following monitored resource types are supported for uptime checks:  uptime_url  gce_instance  gae_app  aws_ec2_instance  aws_elb_load_balancer  Structure is documented below.
* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `period` block supports:

The `selected_regions` block supports:

The `is_internal` block supports:

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `name` -
  A unique resource name for this UptimeCheckConfig. The format is projects/[PROJECT_ID]/uptimeCheckConfigs/[UPTIME_CHECK_ID].


The `name` block contains:

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

UptimeCheckConfig can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_monitoring_uptime_check_config.default {{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.
